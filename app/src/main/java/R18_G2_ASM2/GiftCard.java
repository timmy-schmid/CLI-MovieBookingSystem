/*

Gift Cards: The customer will enter a 16 digit gift card 
number with the suffix GC. These gift cards numbers once redeemed 
should have their status changed to redeemed and no longer redeemable.

Cinema Staff: Cinema staff should be able to insert movie data, delete movie data, modify movie data, add new shows for the upcoming week and choose the selected screen sizes. Cinema staff are also responsible for maintaining the gift card database/file and ensuring all new gift cards are entered accordingly. Only once these gift cards are entered in the database/file by the cinema staff , a customer can use the gift card.


Q: how much money can be stored on a gift card?
-- i.e. default all as 100, if user decides to pay with gift card (prompt them do u wish to pay remaining amount with credit card? or go back option to select gift vs credit card)
