# Assignment 2

Our goal is to develop a movie ticket booking system for FancyCinemas, with the purpose of reducing waiting time for customers + providing them with the choice of viewing/booking movies online.

TODO before running the program:

Command to cleanly run program: first run "gradle build" to generate jar files, and run "java -jar app/build/libs/app-all.jar" to make the password masking work correctly.
